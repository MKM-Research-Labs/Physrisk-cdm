\section{Data Formats and Validation}

\subsection{Date Formats}
All dates should be stored and displayed in YYYY-MM-DD format:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Snapshot Date
  \item Disbursal Date
  \item Last Payment Date
  \item Date of Default

\end{itemize}

  \item Counts: Whole numbers only
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Text Formats}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Encrypted IDs: System-generated encrypted strings
  \item Status values: Predefined set of possible values
  \item Address fields: Free text with appropriate length limits
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Validation Rules}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All monetary amounts must be positive numbers
  \item Dates must be logically consistent (e.g., Last Payment Date cannot be after Snapshot Date)
  \item Percentage values must be between 0 and 100
  \item Required fields must not be empty
  \item Risk scores must be within their defined ranges
  \item Principal and Interest Collected must not exceed loan amount plus total expected interest
\end{itemize}

\section{Calculated Fields}
The following fields are calculated based on other inputs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio = Outstanding Balance / Current Property Value
  \item Days Past Due = Snapshot Date - Last Payment Date (if in arrears)
  \item Total Collected = Principal Collected + Interest Collected
\end{itemize}

\section{Usage Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All monetary values should be entered in the local currency
  \item Dates should be entered using a date picker where available
  \item Status updates should trigger appropriate validations
  \item System should maintain audit trail of changes to key fields
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Loan and Member IDs must be encrypted in storage and display
  \item Personal information must be handled according to data protection regulations
  \item Access to payment history should be role-restricted
  \item All data modifications must be logged with user ID and timestamp
\end{itemize}
